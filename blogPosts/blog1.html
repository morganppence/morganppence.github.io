           <p> Part 2: Calculating Power Requirements </p>
          <p> To calculate resistor values when using a breadboard, I had to take into account the voltage generated by the power supply, the barrel jack, the forward voltage of the LEDs and use this to determine resistor values. As shown by the math and images, I used Ohm’s Law to calculate the resistor values for both a series and parallel circuit based on the LEDs used.</p>
          <p>In my series circuit, I used a yellow and a blue LED. The yellow LEDs have a forward voltage of about 2volts while the blue LEDs have a forward voltage of about 3volts. </p>
          <p>In my parallel circuit, I used 2 blue LEDs.</p>

          <p> Part 1: Threadboard Circuits in Series and Parallel </p>
          <p> In this lab, I worked with parallel and series circuits for the first time. As shown, depending on which circuit is currently being used and the amount of LEDs, the light composition varies. In the series circuit, it presented that the LEDs had the same high level of brightness while in the parallel circuit, the light furthest from the battery seemed duller than the ones closer. After working with 3 LEDs in the parallel circuit, I tested the same circuit but with 2 LEDS and noticed the same pattern. Furthermore, taking away another LED and leaving 1, this singular LED that once was the furthest from the battery was now the brightest that it had been throughout the whole process.

              <br>
              <p>With the knowledge I learned in Part 2, I put my first breadboard circuits together. As seen to the left, I used a breadboard with a 9V power supply which I inserted into a barrel jack connector. The voltage regulator was used to regulate the output from 9V to 5V which I accounted for when using Ohm’s Law. I used a maintained switch which is seen next to the voltage regulator in the top photographs to control when I wanted the LEDs to light up. </p>
